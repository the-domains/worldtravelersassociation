**World Travelers Association** (WTA) believes in the lifestyle of 'Travel for a Purpose' that allows travelers to learn and grow as individuals through self-expanding adventures while also helping improve the lives of others. WTA is an organization which facilitates budget travel creating the custom theme of "Adventure Travel for a Cause." 

**The Adventure:** The adventures facilitate exciting peak experiences, helping gain new skills and perspective. Examples include: learning to surf, hiking, kayaking, and fishing, along with endless other self-expanding experiences.

**The Cause:** What better way to build character and 
assimilate with new cultures than giving back to the community as you 
simultaneously enjoy a vacation? Volunteer efforts may include teaching 
and playing sports with kids (orphans) and/or donating services to local
villages.
